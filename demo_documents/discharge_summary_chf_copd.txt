- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Congestive Heart Failure, acute on chronic, EF 35% (ICD-10: I50.9)
2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease with acute exacerbation (ICD-10: J44.1)
3. Chronic Kidney Disease, Stage 3 (ICD-10: N18.3)
4. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with insulin (ICD-10: E11.9)
5. Hypertension (ICD-10: I10)

HOSPITAL COURSE:
82-year-old female with history of CHF, COPD, CKD presented with progressive dyspnea and lower extremity edema over 5 days. Admitted for diuresis and respiratory management. Responded well to IV Lasix with 8 kg weight loss. Supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula weaned from 4L to 2L. BNP decreased from 2,450 to 680. Creatinine initially elevated to 1.8, improved to baseline 1.3 with fluid management.

FUNCTIONAL STATUS:
- Pre-admission: Modified independent with ADLs, used walker for mobility
- At discharge: Requires minimal to moderate assistance with ADLs due to deconditioning
- Mobility: Ambulates 50 feet with walker and supervision
- Self-Care Score: 11/18 (Barthel Index)
- Cognition: Mild cognitive impairment, BIMS score 10/15

THERAPY EVALUATION SUMMARY:
Physical Therapy:
- Significantly deconditioned from hospital stay and acute illness
- Gait: slow, steady with rolling walker
- Endurance: Limited to 50-100 feet due to dyspnea
- Balance: Fair, requires walker for all mobility
- Recommend PT 5x/week for endurance training and strengthening

Occupational Therapy:
- Requires setup and cueing for bathing
- Able to dress upper body independently, needs assist with lower body
- Energy conservation techniques needed
- Recommend OT 3x/week for ADL training and energy conservation

Speech Therapy:
- No swallowing difficulties
- Mild word-finding difficulties consistent with mild cognitive impairment
- No speech therapy recommended at this time

RESPIRATORY STATUS:
- Requires 2L O2 via nasal cannula for O2 sat >90%
- Dyspnea with exertion, improves with rest
- Lung sounds: diminished bilaterally, no wheezes or rales
- Can manage nebulizer treatments independently

MEDICATIONS AT DISCHARGE:
1. Furosemide 40mg PO BID
2. Lisinopril 10mg PO daily
3. Carvedilol 6.25mg PO BID
4. Albuterol nebulizer Q4H and PRN
5. Ipratropium nebulizer Q6H
6. Insulin Glargine 20 units SC QHS
7. Insulin Lispro per sliding scale
8. Potassium Chloride 20mEq PO daily
9. Atorvastatin 40mg PO QHS

SPECIAL CARE NEEDS:
- Daily weights (notify MD if >3lb gain in 24hr or >5lb gain in week)
- Strict I&O monitoring
- Fluid restriction: 1500mL/day
- 2 gram sodium diet
- O2 via nasal cannula 2L continuous, monitor O2 sat >90%
- Blood glucose monitoring AC and HS
- Fall precautions
- Nebulizer treatments as ordered

CARDIOPULMONARY MONITORING:
- Daily weight and volume status assessment
- Monitor for worsening dyspnea, edema, orthopnea
- Telemetry not required at SNF
- BNP recheck in 2 weeks

DISPOSITION:
Patient discharged to skilled nursing facility for continued rehabilitation, cardiopulmonary monitoring, and medication management. Goal is to regain functional independence and optimize CHF/COPD management for safe return home.

ESTIMATED REHABILITATION NEEDS:
- Projected Length of Stay: 18-21 days
- PT/OT for functional restoration
- Cardiopulmonary monitoring
- Medication optimization

FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS:
- Cardiology follow-up in 2 weeks
- Primary care physician follow-up in 3 weeks
- INR check not required (not on anticoagulation)

PROGNOSIS:
Fair for functional recovery. Multiple comorbidities create ongoing care complexity. Patient historically manages chronic conditions well at home with support from daughter. Goal discharge to home with home health services.
